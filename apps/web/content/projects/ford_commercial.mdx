## Project Goal
Create a realistic commercial-style video for Ford as a personal exercise. The aim was to push myself across the entire 3D pipeline and explore how each discipline contributes to a cinematic final result.

## Role & Scope
I handled every stage of the project—pre-production, production, and post-production—except for the modeling of the car itself. This included environment creation, lighting, animation, look development, compositing, and editing.

## Artistic & Technical Intentions
I wanted to simulate the look and feel of a real automotive commercial, focusing on realism, atmosphere, and visual storytelling. This involved building a large natural environment, designing believable lighting, and carefully crafting shots that highlight the car in a dynamic and cinematic way.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges was integrating the car seamlessly into a vast environment, while maintaining both realism and performance. Optimizing the scene for rendering without sacrificing quality was a key technical hurdle.

## Reflection
This project is still a work in progress. I continue to refine the visuals and improve aspects of shading, lighting, and compositing. There’s a lot left to learn, but this piece marks a meaningful step in my journey as a generalist—combining creative direction with technical execution.
