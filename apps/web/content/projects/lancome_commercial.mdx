## Project Goal
Create a realistic and emotionally rich commercial for a Lancôme perfume, themed around the warmth and luxury of the holiday season. This personal project is designed as a creative exercise, with the goal of producing a piece suitable for social media distribution.

## Scope of Work
I handled the entire production process, excluding only the modeling of the perfume bottle. This includes concept development, layout, environment design, lighting, look development, animation, rendering, compositing, and editing.

## Artistic & Technical Intentions
The aim was to evoke a festive yet elegant mood, combining luxurious visuals with holiday warmth. I focused on cinematic composition, refined lighting, and seasonal elements like snow, all while maintaining a polished, high-end aesthetic.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges was developing a believable look for the snow balancing stylization with realism while integrating it seamlessly into the scene. Crafting a visually appealing and festive layout that fits the brand’s identity was also a key part of the process.

## Ongoing Work & Learning
The project is still in progress. While the current result is close to the kind of aesthetic expected in real commercial ads, I continue to improve the lookdev and refine the details to elevate the piece further.
